This project is to help player of game 2048 to visualize the game when playing
so that user will have a more direct impression on what is going on in the game
Moreover, this game will enable user to be able to see the color changing, the
score changing and the tile value changing along the game. In this game, user
will only need to use arrow key to control the movement of the tile and when 
they want to save the game board to a file so that they can access the board
they leave behind, they only need to press s. When the game over, there will
be a screen on which it says game over. At that point, user won't be able to
move any tiles anymore and the game is over. User use up arrow key to move the
tile up, down to move the tile down, left to move the tile left and right to 
move the tile to the right. The score user obtained will be based on the value
of the newly combined tiles. Only tiles with the same value will be combined 
together and the tiles on the edge will have priority when it comes to combine
